### Output redirection



```bash
$ echo If you can keep your head when all about you >if-1
 # Output redirection
```



```bash
$ cat if-1
```

> If you can keep your head when all about you 



```bash
 echo Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, >>if-1
 # Append to file
```



```bash
 $ cat if-1
```

> If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, 



```bash
 $ echo If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, >if-2
```



```bash
 $ echo But make allowance for their doubting too. >>if-2
```



```bash
 $ cat if-2
```

> If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too. $

```bash
 $ cat if-1 if-2
 # Combine two files
```

> If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too. 



```bash
 $ cat if-1 if-2 >if
 # Output redirection
```



```bash
$ cat if
```

> If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too. 

- **Hint** : output files are created before executing the command

  $ ls > ls.txt
  $ cat ls.txt 
  ```

  

### The standard error channel


```bash
 touch afile
```



```bash
$ ls xyz >output
 # Display an error message
ls: cannot access xyzzy: No such file or directory 
```




```bash
$ cat output
 # output is created but empty
```



```bash
 $ ls xyz 2>output
 # Redirect error
```



```bash
$ cat output
ls: cannot access xyz: No such file or directory $

```

```bash
 $ ls -l afile xyz >output 2>error
 # Redirect output and error
```


```bash
 $ cat output
 -rw-r--r-- 1 dds dds 0 Dec  7 10:51 afile 

```


```bash
 $ cat error
 ls: cannot access xyzzy: No such file or directory $

```



### Input redirection



```bash
$ bc
40 + 2
42
scale = 60
sqrt(2)
1.414213562373095048801688724209698078569671875376948073176679 

```



```bash
$ echo 2 ^ 64 - 1 >chess-rice
$  bc <chess-rice
18446744073709551615
